### Attribution
This is not my original work and belongs to Fupery.  I continue maintenance of this plugin in his absence for my personal use.  As he had the code freely available I have continued that with my updates.  I ask that anyone that uses this plugin have either previously bought it from spigot.  Or please do so in the future if Fupery returns.

Bukkit plugin - allows players to draw directly onto minecraft maps.
